# Server Management

The agent must **never** start or stop the server in this project. Only the user is allowed to bring the server up or down.

## Prohibited Actions

- Do NOT run `npm start` in the `server/` directory
- Do NOT run `npm run start` or any start scripts for the server
- Do NOT run `node src/index.js` or similar commands to start the server
- Do NOT kill or stop server processes

## What to Do Instead

If the server needs to be running for a task:
1. Ask the user to start the server if it's not already running
2. Wait for confirmation before proceeding with server-dependent operations

If the server needs to be restarted:
1. Inform the user that a server restart may be needed
2. Let the user handle the restart themselves
