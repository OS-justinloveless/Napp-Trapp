# iOS Build Verification

After modifying any Swift files in `ios-client/`, you **must** rebuild the iOS app to verify compilation succeeds.

## Build Command

```bash
cd ios-client && make build
```

## Requirements

1. **Always rebuild** after editing Swift files
2. **Check build output** for errors and warnings
3. **Never submit code that doesn't build** - fix all compilation errors before considering the task complete
4. If the build fails, analyze the error and fix it before proceeding

## Build Failure Workflow

1. Run `make build` from `ios-client/`
2. If build fails, read the error output carefully
3. Fix the Swift code causing the failure
4. Rebuild to confirm the fix works
5. Repeat until build succeeds

## Common Issues

- Missing imports: Add required `import` statements
- Type mismatches: Ensure types match expected signatures
- Missing protocol conformances: Implement all required methods
- Syntax errors: Check for typos, missing braces, or semicolons
